You can think of the Path as storing these name elements as a sequence.
The highest element in the directory structure might be located at, index 0.
 The lowest element in the directory structure might be located at index [n-1],
 where n is the number of name elements in the Path. Methods are available for
 retrieving individual elements or a subsequence of the Path using these indexes.
